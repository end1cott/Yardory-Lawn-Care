  - q: "Can I apply a fall pre-emergent and overseed at the same time?"
    a: "No. The pre-emergent barrier will block germination. Either overseed with a seed-safe program (e.g., mesotrione) or use a fall pre-emergent for Poa annua—but not both."
  - q: "How much nitrogen should I apply in the fall?"
    a: "For tall fescue/KBG in Zone 7a, target about 2–3 lb N per 1,000 ft² total for the fall, split across 2–3 applications in September, October, and (if still actively growing) November."
  - q: "What mowing height is best in summer?"
    a: "Maintain 3.5–4.0 inches, especially in heat and in shaded areas, to reduce stress and suppress weeds."

# Philadelphia Lawn Care Calendar (USDA Zone 7a)

This guide is tailored for **Philadelphia and nearby suburbs (Zone 7a)** and focuses on **cool-season grasses**: tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG). It mirrors the timing blocks from our calendar matrix and adds exact rates, soil-temperature triggers, and risk-free "if/then" rules.

<Callout type="warning">
<strong>Golden rule:</strong> <u>Do not combine pre-emergent and seeding in the same season.</u> If you plan a fall overseed, <em>skip the fall pre-emergent</em> (or use a seed-safe approach like mesotrione per label). In spring, apply pre-emergent only after last fall's seedlings are well established (typically 8–12 weeks).

## Quick Temperature & Rate Reference

- **Spring pre-emergent:** apply before soil holds near **55 °F (13 °C)**.  
- **Seeding/overseeding:** target **60–75 °F (16–24 °C)** soil temps — late Aug through late Sep is ideal.  
- **Broadleaf herbicides:** best at **50–85 °F (10–29 °C)**.  
- **Summer irrigation target:** about **1″/week** total (25 mm), mornings preferred.  
- **Mowing height (fescue/KBG):** spring **3.0–3.25″**, summer **3.5–4.0″**, fall **3.0–3.5″**.

## Annual Plan by Task

### Pre-emergent (crabgrass & annual weeds)
**Primary window:** March–April (split application recommended).  
**Optional fall window:** late Aug–Sep for *Poa annua* **only if you are not seeding.**

- Spring: apply the first dose before 55 °F soil temp; a **split** follow-up **6–8 weeks** later extends coverage through our long spring.  
- Fall: consider only for *Poa annua* if **no** overseeding is planned.  
- Avoid aggressive spring aeration right after you apply — it breaks the barrier.

### Overseeding / Reseeding
**Ideal:** late August → late September; **warm falls may allow into mid-October**.

**Rates (per 1,000 ft²):**
- Tall fescue: **4–6 lb** (≈ 200–300 g per 10 m²)  
- KBG: **1–2 lb** (≈ 50–100 g per 10 m²)

**Tips**
- Before seeding, reduce thatch (> **0.5″** needs dethatch), consider **verticut** and/or **core aeration**.  
- Seed-safe mesotrione can help suppress weeds at establishment (follow label).  
- Keep the top 0.5–1″ of soil consistently moist until seedlings root.

### Core Aeration
**Ideal:** September–October.  
Spring is acceptable only lightly and only when the pre-emergent barrier is not needed or already spent.  
Two passes at perpendicular angles on slightly moist soil yields better plug density.

### Dethatch / Verticut
**Ideal:** September; spring only gently. Fescues build less thatch, but use the **0.5″** threshold.

### Fertilization (Nitrogen)
Fall carries the load:

- **September:** **0.75–1.0 lb N/1000 ft²**  
- **October:** **0.5–0.75 lb N/1000 ft²**  
- **November (winterizer):** **0.5–1.0 lb N/1000 ft²** if turf is still actively growing

Spring: light touch only if turf shows need. **Avoid N in summer heat.**

### Broadleaf Weed Control
**Ideal:** September–November (systemics perform best).  
April–May is fine for spot-treatments. **Do not spray >85 °F**, and observe label intervals before/after seeding.

### Grub Control (white grubs)
- **April–May:** **chlorantraniliprole** (early prevention).  
- **June–July:** **neonicotinoids** such as imidacloprid/dinotefuran (prevention).  
- **August:** curatives (e.g., trichlorfon) **only** if thresholds are confirmed.  
Always **water-in** per label.

### Irrigation
Deep and infrequent: aim for **~1″/week** in hot spells.  
- Calibrate with "tuna-can" tests.  
- Water 5–9 AM. On clay, use **cycle-soak** (2–3 shorter cycles to prevent runoff).

### Sodding
Best in spring or fall. Water daily the first week, then taper to deeper, less frequent cycles.

### Soil Testing & Lime
Pull samples in late fall/winter. Lime **only from test results** (pH and buffer). Pelletized lime is easiest for even distribution.

## Month-by-Month (Zone 7a, Philadelphia)

### January–February
- Plan the season, service equipment, order a soil test kit.  
- Watch for ice cover and salt injury along driveways.

### March
- **Pre-emergent #1** before soils hold ~55 °F.  
- Light spring cleanup; first cuts at **3.0–3.25″**.  
- Spot-treat broadleaf weeds as weather allows.

### April
- **Pre-emergent #2 (split)** 6–8 weeks after the first app.  
- Sodding is viable.  
- Light spring N only if turf is hungry.

### May
- Prep for heat: raise mowing to **3.25–3.5″**.  
- **Early grub prevention** (chlorantraniliprole).  
- Irrigate as needed.

### June
- **Neonic grub prevention** per plan.  
- Maintain **3.5–4.0″** mowing; shade areas toward the higher end.  
- Pause N.

### July
- Minimize stress: no aeration/dethatch.  
- Morning irrigation; avoid waterlogging.

### August
- Mid/late month: **begin fall overseeding window**.  
- Prep: **dethatch/verticut**, **core aeration** if needed.  
- If you seed — **do not** apply a fall pre-emergent.

### September
- **Prime month:** overseed, aerate, begin fall nutrition.  
- Optional light topdressing with sand/compost (thin layer).

### October
- Nurture seedlings; **second fall N**.  
- Excellent window for **broadleaf control**.

### November
- **Winterizer** if soils aren't frozen and turf is still active.  
- Mulch or remove leaves (don't smother seedlings).  
- Final mow slightly lower than usual without scalping.

### December
- Off-season: service equipment, pre-order seed/fertilizer.

## Common Mistakes (and Fixes)

1. **Pre-emergent + seeding together:** barrier blocks germination. Plan ahead or use seed-safe chemistry.  
2. **Cutting too low in summer:** increases heat stress and weeds. Use **3.5–4.0″**.  
3. **Frequent shallow watering:** creates shallow roots. Water deeper, less often.  
4. **Summer nitrogen:** fuels burn and disease. Save N for fall.  
5. **Aerating right after pre-emergent:** breaks the barrier; follow the calendar.

## Mini-Checklists

**Pre-overseeding (1–2 weeks before):**
- Measure thatch (remove if **>0.5″**).  
- Map irrigation coverage.  
- Seed on hand: fescue **4–6 lb/1000 ft²**, KBG **1–2 lb/1000 ft²**.  
- Starter fertilizer ready; mesotrione if label allows.

**Post-overseeding (0–4 weeks):**
- Keep the top 0.5–1″ evenly moist.  
- First mow at **3–3.25″** with a sharp blade.  
- Avoid herbicides until label intervals are met.

## FAQ

**Can I apply a fall pre-emergent and overseed at the same time?**  
No. The barrier will block germination. Either overseed with a seed-safe program (e.g., mesotrione) **or** apply a fall pre-emergent for Poa annua — not both.

**How much nitrogen should I apply in the fall?**  
For fescue/KBG in 7a, aim for **~2–3 lb N/1000 ft²** total across 2–3 applications (Sep, Oct, and — if still actively growing — Nov).

**What mowing height is best in summer?**  
Keep it at **3.5–4.0″**, especially on hot, sunny or shaded lawns.
